# CalmSync-v1
CalmSync is a real-time neurofeedback system built in Python. It analyzes EEG signals from the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile 2, calculates the Alpha/Beta ratio to deduce mental state (Stress/Relaxation), and drives an interactive game in mBlock. Session history is securely logged to MySQL and archived as detailed LaTeX reports.
